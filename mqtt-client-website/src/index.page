Overview
--------

MQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things" connectivity
protocol. It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe
messaging transport. It is useful for connections with remote locations where
a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium.
